- [x] Implement TCache
- [x] Get allocations and frees working
- [ ] Implement Red-Black tree
- [x] Implement large allocations
- [ ] Add freed large allocations to RB tree
- [ ] Collect tail waste on bump allocator
- [ ] Ensure Atomic's and Locks are used everywhere and Option's aren't just floating around
- [ ] Ensure error enums dont use redundant `Error` suffixes in their variants
- [ ] Split static code into lookup and arena specific code
- [ ] Implement `thread_local!` and drop `rust-std` dependency
- [ ] Generate header using `cbindgen` crate
- [ ] Cleanup dependencies
- [ ] Fix clippy warnings
- [ ] Unify `BMStore` and `TCStore` into a `UnsafeStore<T>`
- [ ] All alignment and other methods should return `PrimResult` instead of using `Option`. Error enums have to be adjusted accordingly.
- [ ] Extract code from global alloc and create separate interface for arena specific allocators
- [ ] Work on `TODO`s in the code
- [ ] Review all types prefere safety over performance
- [ ] Bump overhaul types, speed and safety
- [x] TCache needs deallocate method
- [ ] Iterator for Radix-Tree
- [ ] CRITICAL: Iterate tree in arena destructor to destruct slabs
- [ ] Remove giveup trait
- [ ] Large allocations can't be freed at arena drop
- [ ] With iterator when arena is destroyed ensure to remove all nodes related to arena id
